ReadMe Duplicated from the Workshop Page found here [Steam Workshop Page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2538444208)

A Simple Solution for Finding the Grid of a Target Location
Introducing Simple Grid Designators, Now With Markers and Unlimited Compatibility!?!?

What was that? "Ace has map tools use those to get accurate grids"
What you think I'm some kinda Nerd get outta here with your Math and Smart things
UGG UGG GIB COORDS

Version 2.0.0 Is Here, I like to dub it the Unlimited Compatibility Edition
Ideally this version of the mod should work with any and All Vehicles, Designators and Combination of the Both!

I think my Time with Arma 3 is over, With over 6 thousand Hours of Playtime and probably half of that Making Mods, Missions and Such, I think it's time I lay it to bed, I am currently working on Developing my Own game it's nothing to write home about right now but I am slowly making progress.

"Does this mean you won't update this anymore?" for the most part yes, But I likely will try to maintain it at least for another 7~ months or more precisely the 15th of July 2024 My 25th Birthday

It's been a fun run but both Groups I played with have stopped playing the game and I can't really find the motivation to continue.

Yes I know I sound like a Posh arsehole in the video
I'm not Posh I'm Australian ;~;

Some Notes
  Current Mod Version is 2.1.2, you can check yours on the main menu by hovering the mods icon.
  If your Version does not Match, Repair it in the launcher.
  If the Laser you are using doesn't have the UI you may need to add the Magazine for it to the Array in the Addon Options
  The Buttons are not bound by default.


The Vehicle and/or Designator I am using doesn't have the UI
First off they will need to have a Laser as per the Vanilla Implementation.
If they do, add their Weapon/Turret Magazine to the Array in the Addon Options.

I already added RHS's custom Magazines and the Vanilla One to get you started!

Idea and Inspiration
Simple Grid Designators was heavily influenced and more or less based on Enhanced Designators made by MadMax.
You can find Madmax's Version Here.


Features
  Laser Designators Show 8 and 10 Digit Coordinates of the Lasers Target
  This Functionality Works on most if not all Vehicles with a Laser Designator
  CBA setting to turn said Features off for the Hand Held Designators
  CBA setting to use Vanilla Marker Classes, for when the Mod is Optional (Thanks Eughenos)
  Ability to place Map Marker on Laser's Position with Grid and Optional ASL and Timestamp
  The Relative Marker just gives you a Range and Bearing from the 1st Point to the Second,Like the Ace Vector

  And to that I say "Yes"
  Unfortunately most of what I changed had to do with the Behind the Scenes Stuff which should be mostly fixed up and Forward compatible in most Cases except for a Few

Are you still working on this?

The Short Answer No
I left a Message further up the Page to really fill in for this but After 6 thousand hours, I think it's time I put it to rest.


Credit where Credit is Due

So in Terms of Credits
    MadMax
    For the Idea and Base work considering his mod is the Older Grandpa of this mod, which as I was writing this gave me the go head to upload this "Successor?" of his mod
    Grumpy Old Man
    He Provided the Nice PosToGrid Function this Mod Abuses heavily to provide the actual grid coordinates. As of Version 1.0 I have striped down Grumpy Old Man's function and streamlined it but I will obviously still leave the credit to him

A Simple Solution for Finding the Grid of a Target Location
Introducing Simple Grid Designators, Now With Markers and Unlimited Compatibility!?!?

What was that? "Ace has map tools use those to get accurate grids"
What you think I'm some kinda Nerd get outta here with your Math and Smart things

I have reinstalled Arma 3 and Development of this Mod will continue, Keep a Look out for Version 2.0.0, It's likely going to be quite different to the current version of Simple Grid Designators
Version 2.0.0 Is Here, I like to dub it the Unlimited Compatibility Edition
Ideally this version of the mod should work with any and All Vehicles, Designators and Combination of the Both!

Yes I know I sound like a Posh arsehole in the video
I'm not Posh I'm Australian ;~;

Some Notes
Current Mod Version is 2.1.2, you can check yours on the main menu by hovering the mods icon.
If your Version does not Match, Repair it in the launcher.
If the Laser you are using doesn't have the UI you may need to add the Magazine for it to the Array in the Addon Options
The Buttons are not bound by default.

The Vehicle and/or Designator I am using doesn't have the UI
First off they will need to have a Laser as per the Vanilla Implementation.
If they do, add their Weapon/Turret Magazine to the Array in the Addon Options.

I already added RHS's custom Magazines and the Vanilla One to get you started!

Idea and Inspiration
Simple Grid Designators was heavily influenced and more or less based on Enhanced Designators made by MadMax.
You can find Madmax's Version Here.

Features
Laser Designators Show 8 and 10 Digit Coordinates of the Lasers Target
This Functionality Works on most if not all Vehicles with a Laser Designator
CBA setting to turn said Features off for the Hand Held Designators
CBA setting to use Vanilla Marker Classes, for when the Mod is Optional (Thanks Eughenos)
Ability to place Map Marker on Laser's Position with Grid and Optional ASL and Timestamp
The Relative Marker just gives you a Range and Bearing from the 1st Point to the Second,Like the Ace Vector

And to that I say "Yes"
Unfortunately most of what I changed had to do with the Behind the Scenes Stuff which should be mostly fixed up and Forward compatible in most Cases except for a Few

Known Bugs?
None!

Planned
Nothing At the Moment

Are you still working on this?
Yes!

I have returned to Arma 3 Modding and Scripting, I will working on this mod and my 3D Map Markers mod alongside a Gamemode I am creating that is similar to KP/GRUEH Liberation but re imagined how I would have done it.

For Simple Grid Designators I am looking forward to throwing out most of the Mod and Rebuilding it from the ground up.

In the time since I made this mod and Left and Came back to Arma several Times my Skills have grown drastically and I am very confident that the next Version of Simple Grid while not looking too flashy will be the biggest change yet hopefully making it as compatible as I can with Vehicles and Gear Alike.

This will also allow me to remove the Ace requirement to the mod which is mostly just a fix because I overwrite the UI for the Designators and Drone cameras, With the Rewrite that won't be necessary.

All of this has Been Achieved with Version 2.0.0!

Credit where Credit is Due

So in Terms of Credits
MadMax
For the Idea and Base work considering his mod is the Older Grandpa of this mod, which as I was writing this gave me the go head to upload this "Successor?" of his mod

Grumpy Old Man
He Provided the Nice PosToGrid[forums.bohemia.net] Function this Mod Abuses heavily to provide the actual grid coordinates. As of Version 1.0 I have striped down Grumpy Old Man's function and streamlined it but I will obviously still leave the credit to him
